All of the tutorials in the Workers documentation use [Wrangler][2], Cloudflare's open-source command-line tool for managing Cloudflare Workers projects. To begin, youâ€™ll need to [install Wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler#-installation) on your machine.

To confirm that Wrangler has successfully installed on your machine, run `wrangler --help` on the command-line:

Once you've installed Wrangler, it's time to start building your first Cloudflare Workers application, in the next part of our Quick Start guide, ["Generate a Project"](/quickstart/generate-a-project).
