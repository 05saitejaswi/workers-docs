Worker Sites is a feature of Wrangler that allows you to easily deploy static assets to the Cloudflare edge.

_Note: Worker Sites require the latest version of [Wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler) and the Workers [Unlimited plan](https://workers.cloudflare.com/sites#plans)._

To use this feature, you'll take one of three routes:

- [Create a new project from scratch](/sites/start-from-scratch): Start from a blank slate and deploy an HTML based site to the Workers Platform.
- [Deploy a pre-existing static site project](/sites/start-from-existing): Already have a static site project? Using a pre-existing site generated from popular generators like Hugo, Jekyll, or Gatsby and deploy to the Workers Platform.
- [Add static assets to a pre-existing worker project](/sites/start-from-worker): Start with a pre-existing project on the Workers Platform and add static asset serving to it.
