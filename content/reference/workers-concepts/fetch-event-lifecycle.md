title: The Fetch Event Lifecycle
---

When working with the [`fetch` event](/reference/runtime/apis/fetch-event) inside the Workers runtime, it helps to have a good idea of its lifecycle.

The runtime lifecycle starts when it receives a request; it triggers a `fetch` event and passes a [Fetch Event Object](/reference/runtime/apis/fetch-event) to registered `fetch` handlers - this happens when the function is called via [HTTP(S) routes](/reference/workers-concepts/routes). Then `respondWith()` or `waitUntil()` are called on the `Request` object within the Worker code, continuing the FetchEvent lifecycle:

## `respondWith()`

Intercepts the request and allows users to send a custom response. 

If a `fetch` event handler does not call `respondWith()`, the runtime delivers the event to the next registered `fetch` event handler. If no event handler calls `respondWith()`, the runtime proxies the request to the origin. Note: If no origin is setup (always true for workers.dev sites), then you must have a `respondWith()` called for a valid response.

## `waitUntil()`

 Extends the lifetime of the event using a `Promise` passed into the function. Use this method to notify the runtime to wait for tasks, such as streaming and caching, that run longer than the usual time it takes to send a response. This is good for handling logging and analytics to third-party services, where you don't want to block the `response`.

## `passThroughOnException()`

Causes the script to "fail open" (meaning the execution of code is not halted) on unhandled exceptions. Instead of returning a runtime error response, the runtime proxies the request to its destination. To prevent JavaScript errors from causing entire requests to fail on uncaught exceptions, `passThroughOnException()` causes the Worker to act as if the exception wasnâ€™t there. This allows you to yield control to your origin server.
