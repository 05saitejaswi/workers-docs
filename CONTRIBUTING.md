## Contributing to the Cloudflare Workers documentation

The Cloudflare Workers documentation helps developers understand and build on the Workers platform. It provides:
* a quick-start guide for using our command-line tool [Wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler)
* tutorials on how to build applications with Workers
* a reference section explaining how the Workers platform and the provided APIs function
* a Template Gallery to discover what you can build with Workers

At this time, we're accepting contributions to the Template Gallery, as well as fixes to any small issues with other parts of the documentation. As you contribute to this repository, either in the form of creating issues, or submitting pull requests, this contribution guide is designed to help you understand the process, and make it easier for both the community and the Cloudflare team to work well together!

If you have any questions that _aren't_ answered by this contribution guide, let us know! This document, like everything else in this repository, is a work in progress, and we'd love to know how we can make it better.

#### **Did you find a typo in the docs, or an issue with a code sample?**

* **Note that we can't provide support for the Workers platform in this repository.** Please visit the Workers [support page](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/sections/360000215372-Cloudflare-Workers) for assistance.

* **Ensure that the issue was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-dovs/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-docs/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible.

* For more detailed information on submitting a bug report and creating an issue, visit our [reporting guidelines](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#reporting-an-issue).

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you want to add a new section to the Reference portion of the docs?**

* Generally, we aren't accepting submissions that are substantial new sections of the Reference portion of the docs. This includes the Tooling section, where we have a small amount of documentation for third-party tooling, such as the Serverless framework. This section of the docs is subject to internal review inside of Cloudflare, so we're unable to accept community contributions at this time.

#### **Do you want to submit a new tutorial?**

* We currently aren't accepting new full-length tutorials in the docs. If you've written a tutorial about building something with Workers and want to share it on your own blog or elsewhere, great! We'd be happy to help you share it (ping [@signalnerve](https://twitter.com/signalnerve) on Twitter), but due to the large amount of review and process around tutorials in this repository, we're unable to add new community tutorials at this time.

#### **Do you have questions about how to use Workers, or need help with your code?**

* Check out the Workers [Community Forum](https://community.cloudflare.com/c/developers/workers), where members of our community answer questions about how to build projects with Workers. We'd love to see you there!

#### **Do you want to contribute a template to the Template Gallery?**

* Please read the Template Gallery [contribution guide](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-docs/blob/master/content/templates/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Thank you! :heart: :heart: :heart:
