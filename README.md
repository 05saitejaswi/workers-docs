# Cloudflare Workers Documents

This project contains the static website content for the [Cloudflare Workers documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/).

## Installation

Ensure you have the the following installed:

- [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) version 0.32.2
- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 9

You also need to run `npm install` before building; in order to make sure this succeeds, make sure you are connected to the VPN and have added your private key to your `ssh-agent` using:

`ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa` (yours might be named differently, just make sure you use a private key file (no .pub extension))

## Usage

All commands are packaged in `Makefile`. The available commands are:

- `make build` - generate HTML files from MD and templates.
- `make deploy` - deploy documents
- `make serve` - generate HTML files continuously and serve at localhost:1313/workers/ to iterate content

The most useful option on a normal basis is:

    `make serve`

You can now edit the .md files and the HTML files will be autogenerated.

## Releasing

~This project is automatically built to HTML and released on new pushes to `master`~ - as the new version of this repo is still in-progress, this version of the docs aren't currently being released. A staging version is in progress!

## Contributing

These docs are only valuable because folks like you took the time to contribute! If you run into a question not answered here, donâ€™t just get the answer, make the docs better.

This repo is overseen by the Workers Developer Experience team.
