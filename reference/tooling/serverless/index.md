# Serverless Plugin

The [Serverless Framework](https://github.com/serverless/serverless) helps you develop and deploy serverless applications using [Cloudflare Workers](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-workers/). It's a CLI that offers structure, automation, and best practices out-of-the-box, allowing you to focus on building sophisticated, event-driven, serverless architectures, comprised of Functions and Events. 

The Serverless Framework manages the infrastructure as a [Serverless Plugin](TODO: link to plugin) that turns your version controlled code into a Worker(s) deployed globally with one command. [One config file](TODO link to config) directs where exactly this Worker will live, so you can modify code and have it re-built and re-deployed in moments. No visits to the browser required.

Get started using serverless with Cloudflare Workers in this [quick start guide to the plugin](TODO: link to quick start and ref (maybe will look similar to entry to docs? )

*Note:`workers.dev` domains are not currently supported using Serverless, but you can track our progress on [this Github issue](TODO: open a link Github issue).*
